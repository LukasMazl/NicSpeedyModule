# NIC Speedy Module

This repository has been created for demonstrating of problem which appears in systems
with big number of NICs (for example Docker systems). 
In /module_tests are created tests which measure total time of getting info about
system NICs. 
Each test is written for different python module.
 
Current results of testing modules you can see [here.](./current_rest_results.txt)

## TODO LIST

- [ ] Add a new test case for Ethtool module
- [ ] Create python function for better manipulating with output data from my_module.c.
- [ ] Rename my_module.c
